Users are able to add, update, delete and mark items as purchased in real time. Items marked purchased are crossed out and a check mark will display next to item. I tried to create a checkbox next to all the items but due to a lack of time I went will the "crossing off" option.

>If I had more time on the project, I would like to allow users to create multiple lists and add an "amount" box to fill in as well.  Pricing would be a great addition. I think I would also like the store and any coupons that might be available for items listed.
